        <p>
         I had wanted to attend Vipassana for a few years — ever since a friend of mine told me it was a powerful experience. I saw the changes in her afterward: she was calmer, more composed, and there was something peaceful about her presence. That left an impression on me.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          So, I told myself, “What do I have to lose?” I finally registered almost two months in advance, thinking that would give me enough time to mentally prepare myself.
        </p>

        <div class="instruction-steps">
          <h4> How I registered.</h4>

            <li>Two weeks before the course begins, they’ll email again to confirm whether you’ve changed your mind.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
          I woke up at 6 a.m. on the day of departure. There were still a few things I needed to do before heading to Dhamma Shringa for Vipassana.I had to buy two soaps — one for laundry and another for bathing. Coincidentally, it was also my last day at the office since I had already submitted my resignation. I hadn’t even packed my clothes or other essentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the morning was a bit of a rush. I went to the office, completed some paperwork, handed over all the equipment, and said goodbye to a few of my friends. By the time I got home, it was 11:30 a.m. I quickly ate some roti, booked a Pathao, and headed toward Budhanilkantha.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instructions said everyone should reach the center before 1 p.m., and when I left at 12:20 p.m., I thought I was running late. Later, I realized that rule was just a smart way to make sure everyone arrived on time. When I reached, I was slightly anxious — I don’t like being late — but people were still coming in even after me.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the center, we had to register again. The same questions were asked, and after filling out the form, I submitted it to the office as instructed. New students were interviewed individually to check whether they could handle the rigorous 10-day retreat.
          When it was my turn, one of the senior uncles asked if I knew the rules. I said yes. Then he asked me to recite them.
          At that moment, I froze. It felt like being in an exam hall. My mind went blank. The funny part? He was speaking in clear Nepali, and I still couldn’t understand what he meant. I’m Nepali — and yet there I was, fumbling in my own language.
          He smiled and handed me a small rulebook since I couldn’t recite the rules. It was written in Nepali too. I just nodded, half embarrassed and half amused, thinking, “Great start.”
        </p>

        <h3>
          Day 1
        </h3>
        <p>
          The first day began early with a bell at 4:00 a.m. I brushed my teeth, made my bed, and soon after, the warning bell rang again — signaling that we had ten minutes to reach the meditation hall. My assigned seat was E7, which coincidentally reminded me of a chess position — a small detail that stuck with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The schedule at Dhamma Shring is followed very strictly. If anyone is not present in the meditation hall on time, one of the servers (volunteers) comes to check. The first day was quite challenging, mainly because I had to sit for nearly 10 hours during the meditation sessions. It was something my body wasn’t used to. At 6:30 a.m., breakfast was served. The food was simple but very good — all vegetarian. The menu included kheer, haluwa, cornflakes, tea, milk, herbal tea, biscuits, bread with jam, chana (peas), chiura (flattened rice), peanuts, and a stringy sweet dish with milk (I wasn’t sure of the name).
        </p>
        <p>
          Lunch was served around 11:00 a.m. It consisted of roti, bhaat (rice), kheer, dal, mutter (peas), kidney beans, achar (pickle), saag (leafy greens), tarkari (vegetable curry), papad, curd, a sweet item, and salad. I didn’t have much trouble maintaining silence, though I do have a habit of talking to myself occasionally — which I had to be mindful about. Day 1 ended with some back and body ache due to long sitting hours. Lights were turned off at 9:30 p.m., marking the end of the first day.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Day 2 - 3
        </h3>
        <p>
          Woke up at 3:45 a.m., waiting for the morning bell.
          Followed the same routine as usual. On this day, I realized something important. I saw the Guru (teacher) walking with some difficulty, probably due to knee pain. It made me think — I cannot sit like this forever. I need to move. Since running wasn’t allowed, I decided to walk briskly during free time. It felt refreshing and helped my body relax. By the third day, my concentration had improved noticeably. This was also the day we were introduced to Vipassana meditation, which involves scanning the entire body from head to toe and observing sensations without reacting to them. The daily schedule remained the same. Slept at 9:30 p.m.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Day 4
        </h3>
        <p>
          This day was different. A new rule was introduced:
          We now had to sit completely still for one hour without changing position — known as Adhittāna or the “sitting of strong determination.”

          The fixed sessions were:
          <ol>
            <pre>
              8:00 – 9:00 a.m.

              2:30 – 3:30 p.m.

              6:00 – 7:00 p.m.
          </pre>

          </ol>

          The instruction was clear — do not move, but if the discomfort becomes unbearable, change your position. Try to reduce the number of movements over time.

          At first, it was very hard. I could only manage 20 minutes before needing to move. Then I decided to use my watch to time myself and slowly increase the duration.

          I also added walking to my daily routine to help balance the long hours of sitting:
          <pre>
          6:30 – 7:00 a.m. – Breakfast

          7:00 – 7:20 a.m. – Rest

          7:20 – 7:50 a.m. – Walk

          11:00 – 11:30 a.m. – Lunch

          11:30 – 12:15 p.m. – Rest

          12:15 – 12:50 p.m. – Walk

          5:00 – 5:20 p.m. – Tea

          5:20 – 5:50 p.m. – Walk
          </pre>

          That evening, during the 6:00 – 7:00 p.m. session, something interesting happened. I became completely focused — no wandering thoughts. I could observe my breath and sensations deeply for about 45 minutes without distraction. It felt different, peaceful. I thought maybe the walking helped me reach that state.

          Slept at 9:30 p.m.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Day 5
        </h3>
        <p>
          Woke up at 3:55 a.m. and followed the same routine.

I kept trying to sit in the same position for one full hour. The maximum I could manage was 33 minutes. I was starting to get a bit bored, so I played with the stopwatch on my watch — trying to hit exactly 1.00, but I kept getting 0.99.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Day 6
        </h3>
        <p>
          Routine was the same, but this day was different.

          During the 6:00 – 7:00 p.m. session, where we were not supposed to move, something powerful happened. While meditating, I focused deeply on a single memory. Suddenly, I started feeling vibrations throughout my entire body. The sensation kept intensifying, and at the same time, I began to cry.

          There was a moment when, with my eyes closed, everything felt white — the vibrations were at their peak. Then a thought arose:
          “Should I let go or hold on?”

          I hesitated and decided to hold on. The vibrations slowly faded, and I came back to awareness — still crying. It was a surreal experience.

          Even that night, I could still feel subtle vibrations while trying to sleep. It was difficult to fall asleep.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Day 7 - 9
        </h3>
        <p>
          After the experience on Day 6, I wanted to feel it again. I tried many times, but it didn’t happen. These three days were mentally tough. I began to feel frustrated and restless during meditation — sometimes even angry or irritated internally.

          But I continued the practice, reminding myself that it’s all part of the process.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Day 10
        </h3>
        <p>
          The final day.

          At 9:00 a.m., we broke the Noble Silence and finally spoke to one another after ten days. The silence ended, and the atmosphere suddenly became lively. I talked to a few foreigners, shared my experiences, and listened to theirs. It felt light and joyful.

          Before leaving, I wanted to complete one last goal — sitting for a full one hour without moving.
          And this time, I did it.
        </p>


        
        <h3>
          What I Thought Meditation/Vipassana Was
        </h3>
        <p>
          I had been trying to meditate for quite some time, though not very seriously. One of my college friends was the first person to plant the seed of meditation in me. I still remember him sitting in a dark room during our bachelor days, trying to meditate in complete silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got back home, I decided to try it too — but without any real understanding of what meditation actually was. I didn’t ask anyone how it was done or what it meant. I simply tried it on my own, without guidance or structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, it was like a blind leading the blind. I guess I was a bit strong-headed back then — not very good at listening to people or following instructions. I just wanted to figure things out my own way.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, my version of “meditation” was something like this:
          <pre>“Breathe, think about the past, and analyze it.”</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          If a thought triggered an emotional reaction — sadness, anger, regret — I would let it come out.
          <pre>
            Yes → cry or get angry about it.
            No → move on to the next thought.
          </pre>
          That was my process.
          Even after watching videos about meditation, I never really followed through. I understood the idea intellectually, but not in practice.
        </p>

        <h3>What Vipassana Actually Was</h3>

        <p>
          In simple terms, Vipassana begins with Anapana — focusing on the breath. You observe the natural breath as it is.
          But it’s not just about the air going in and out. You start to notice everything that comes with it — the tiny sensations around your nostrils, the movement of hair inside the nose, the subtle tingling or warmth behind the nasal wall. You don’t name or label anything; you simply observe.
        </p>

        <p>
          <pre>No judging. No reacting. No controlling. Just observing.</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes Vipassana itself — the practice of scanning the entire body.
          You move your attention gradually from the top of your head to the tips of your toes:
          <pre>Head → Face → Shoulders → Arms → Chest → Stomach → Back → Lower back → Legs → private parts.</pre>

          You observe everything — itchiness, pain, heat, vibration, numbness, or even nothing at all.
          You don’t label sensations as good or bad — you just notice them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because everything comes and goes.
          The pain arises — and it passes.
          The calm arises — and it passes too.

          That’s the essence of Vipassana:
          <pre>To observe impermanence without reaction.</pre>
        </p>

        <h3>
          What I Should Have Been Doing in the Meditation Hall
        </h3>
        <p>
          For the first three days, known as the Anapana stage, I was supposed to simply observe the sensation of breathing — the air going in and out through the nostrils. Nothing else. No imagination, no thinking, no analysis. Just sit still, feel the natural breath, and be aware of the tiny sensations that come with it — maybe the warmth of the exhale, a slight tingling, or the subtle touch of air.
        </p>
        <p>
         From the fourth to the tenth day, the practice shifted to Vipassana — observing the entire body by scanning it, bit by bit, from head to toe. The idea was to bring awareness to every single sensation in the body — warmth, pain, pressure, itching, vibration, or even a sense of nothingness — and observe them without reacting. No craving when it felt pleasant. No aversion when it hurts. Just observation, acceptance, and understanding that everything is impermanent (anicca). 
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had done that properly, I would have been sitting quietly, scanning my body in order, noticing sensations as they arose and disappeared, and maintaining calm equanimity.
          That’s what I should have been doing.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What I Was Actually Doing in the Meditation Hall
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’ve always been an overthinker — I analyze everything: my surroundings, myself, and others. So, trying not to think and simply observe my breath was… not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
           There I was, inside the meditation hall, trying my best to focus. Focused on my breathing — and then my mind went left, then right. My past. My future.
          <pre>
            “Ohh shit! I need to focus on my breathing.”
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          I told myself,<pre>“Okay, this time I’ll really do it.”</pre>
          Focused again on my breathing.
          Then suddenly — <pre>“Food is really good here.”</pre>
          Focused again.
          <pre>“Man, I have so many things to do.”</pre>
          Focused again.
          <pre>“Damn, Silksong was really good.”</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Backache. Legs hurting.
          I couldn’t stay in one position for too long.
          Songs started playing in my head.
          <pre>“Focus on breathing,”</pre> I told myself.
          Change position — ah, that felt better.
          Then my mind wandered again: E7… E7… wait, E7 is a chess position.
          E1, E2, E3, E4 — white already made the move.
          Now it’s my turn.
          Focus on breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirty minutes already gone.
        </p>
